$content = @"
As with any Microsoft Copilot, a prompt refers to the text-based, natural language input you provide in the prompt bar that instructs Security Copilot to generate a response. The quality of the response that Security Copilot returns depends in large part on the quality of the prompt used. In general, a well-crafted prompt with clear and specific inputs leads to more useful responses by Security Copilot.

Elements of an effective prompt:
Effective prompts give Security Copilot adequate and useful parameters to generate a valuable response. Security analysts or researchers should include the following elements when writing a prompt:
‚Ä¢ Goal - specific, security-related information that you need
‚Ä¢ Context - why you need this information or how you plan to use it
‚Ä¢ Expectations - format or target audience you want the response tailored to
‚Ä¢ Source - known information, data sources, or plugins Security Copilot should use

Other prompting tips:
‚Ä¢ Be specific, clear, and concise as much as you can about what you want to achieve. You can always start simply with your first prompt, but as you get more familiar with Security Copilot, include more details following the elements of an effective prompt.
‚Ä¢ Iterate. Subsequent prompts are typically needed to either clarify what you need further, or try other versions of a prompt to get closer to what you're looking for.
‚Ä¢ Provide necessary context to narrow down where Security Copilot looks for data.
‚Ä¢ Give positive instructions instead of what not to do. Security Copilot is geared toward action, so telling it what you want it to do for exceptions is more productive.
‚Ä¢ Directly address Security Copilot as You, as in, You should ... or You must ..., as this is more effective than referring to it as a model or assistant.
